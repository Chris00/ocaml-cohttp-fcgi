<h3><a name="S1">1. Introduction</a></h3>

FastCGI is an open extension to CGI that provides high performance
for all Internet applications without the penalties of Web server
APIs.<p>

This specification has narrow
goal: to specify, from an application perspective, the
interface between a FastCGI application and a Web server that supports
FastCGI.  Many Web server features related to FastCGI,
e.g. application management facilities, have nothing to do with the
application to Web server interface, and are not described here.</p><p>

This specification is for Unix (more precisely, for POSIX systems that support
Berkeley Sockets).  The bulk of the specification is a simple
communications protocol that is independent of byte ordering
and will extend to other systems.</p><p>

We'll introduce FastCGI by comparing it with conventional Unix
implementations of CGI/1.1.

FastCGI is designed to support long-lived application processes,
i.e. <i>application servers</i>.  That's a major difference
compared with conventional Unix implementations of CGI/1.1,
which construct an application process, use
it respond to one request, and have it exit.</p><p>

The initial state of a FastCGI process is more spartan than the initial
state of a CGI/1.1 process, because the FastCGI process doesn't begin life
connected to anything.  It doesn't have the conventional open files
<tt>stdin</tt>, <tt>stdout</tt>, and <tt>stderr</tt>, and it doesn't
receive much information through environment variables.  The key
piece of initial state in a FastCGI process is a listening
socket, through which it accepts connections from a Web server.</p><p>

After a FastCGI process accepts a connection on its listening socket,
the process executes a simple protocol to receive and send data.  The
protocol serves two purposes.  First, the protocol
multiplexes a single transport connection between several independent
FastCGI requests.  This supports applications that are able to process
concurrent requests using event-driven or multi-threaded programming
techniques.  Second, within each request the protocol provides several
independent data streams in each direction.  This way, for instance,
both <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> data pass over a single
transport connection from the application to the Web server, rather
than requiring separate pipes as with CGI/1.1.</p><p>

A FastCGI application plays one of several well-defined <i>roles</i>.
The most familiar is the <i>Responder</i> role, in which the
application receives all the information associated with an HTTP
request and generates an HTTP response; that's the role CGI/1.1
programs play.  A second role is <i>Authorizer</i>, in which the
application receives all the information associated with an HTTP
request and generates an authorized/unauthorized decision.
A third role is <i>Filter</i>, in which the
application receives all the information associated with an HTTP
request, plus an extra stream of data from a file stored on the Web
server, and generates a "filtered" version of the data stream as
an HTTP response.  The framework is extensible so that more FastCGI
can be defined later.</p><p>

In the remainder of this specification the terms "FastCGI
application," "application process," or "application server" are
abbreviated to "application" whenever that won't cause confusion.</p><p>



</p><h3><a name="S2">2. Initial Process State</a></h3>


<h4><a name="S2.1">2.1 Argument list</a></h4>

By default the Web server creates an argument list containing a single
element, the name of the application, taken to be the last component
of the executable's path name.  The Web server may provide a way
to specify a different application name, or a more elaborate argument
list.<p>

Note that the file executed by the Web server might be an interpreter
file (a text file that starts with the characters <tt>#!</tt>), in
which case the application's argument list is constructed as described
in the <tt>execve</tt> manpage.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S2.2">2.2 File descriptors</a></h4>

The Web server leaves a single file descriptor,
<tt>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</tt>, open when the application begins
execution.  This descriptor refers to a listening socket created by
the Web server.<p>

<tt>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</tt> equals <tt>STDIN_FILENO</tt>.
The standard descriptors
<tt>STDOUT_FILENO</tt> and <tt>STDERR_FILENO</tt> are closed when
the application begins execution.  A reliable method for an application
to determine whether it was invoked using CGI or FastCGI is to call
<tt>getpeername(FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO)</tt>, which returns
-1 with <tt>errno</tt> set to <tt>ENOTCONN</tt> for
a FastCGI application.</p><p>

The Web server's choice of reliable transport, Unix stream pipes
(<tt>AF_UNIX</tt>) or TCP/IP (<tt>AF_INET</tt>), is implicit in the
internal state of the <tt>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</tt> socket.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S2.3">2.3 Environment variables</a></h4>

The Web server may use environment variables to pass parameters
to the application.  This specification defines one such
variable, <tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</tt>; we expect more to
be defined as the specification evolves.

The Web server may provide a way to bind other environment
variables, such as the <tt>PATH</tt> variable.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S2.4">2.4 Other state</a></h4>

The Web server may provide a way to specify other components of an
application's initial process state, such as the priority,
user ID, group ID, root directory, and working directory of the
process.<p>



</p><h3><a name="S3">3. Protocol Basics</a></h3>


<h4><a name="S3.1">3.1 Notation</a></h4>

We use C language notation to define protocol message
formats.  All structure elements are defined in terms
of the <tt>unsigned char</tt> type, and are arranged
so that an ISO C compiler lays them out in the obvious
manner, with no padding.  The first byte defined in the
structure is transmitted first, the second byte second, etc.<p>

We use two conventions to abbreviate our definitions.</p><p>

First, when two adjacent structure components are named identically
except for the suffixes "<tt>B1</tt>" and "<tt>B0</tt>," it means that
the two components may be viewed as a single number, computed as
<tt>B1&lt;&lt;8 + B0</tt>.  The name of this single number is the name of
the components, minus the suffixes.  This convention generalizes in an
obvious way to handle numbers represented in more than two bytes.</p><p>

Second, we extend C <tt>struct</tt>s to allow the form
</p><pre>        struct {
            unsigned char mumbleLengthB1;
            unsigned char mumbleLengthB0;
            ... /* other stuff */
            unsigned char mumbleData[mumbleLength];
        };
</pre>
meaning a structure of varying length, where the length of
a component is determined by the values of the indicated
earlier component or components.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S3.2">3.2 Accepting Transport Connections</a></h4>

A FastCGI application calls <tt>accept()</tt> on the socket referred to
by file descriptor <tt>FCGI_LISTENSOCK_FILENO</tt> to accept a new
transport connection.

If the <tt>accept()</tt> succeeds, and the <tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</tt>
environment variable is bound, the application
application immediately performs the following
special processing:<p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</tt>:

        The value is a list of valid IP addresses for the Web server.<p>

        If <tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</tt>
        was bound, the application checks the peer
        IP address of the new connection for membership in the list.
        If the check fails (including the possibility that the
        connection didn't use TCP/IP transport), the application
        responds by closing the connection.</p><p>

        <tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS</tt>
        is expressed as a comma-separated list of IP
        addresses.  Each IP address is written as four decimal numbers
        in the range [0..255] separated by decimal points.  So one
        legal binding for this variable is
        <tt>FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS=199.170.183.28,199.170.183.71</tt>.</p><p>
</p></li></ul>

An application may accept several concurrent transport
connections, but it need not do so.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S3.3">3.3 Records</a></h4>

Applications execute requests from a Web server using a simple
protocol.  Details of the protocol depend upon the application's role,
but roughly speaking the Web server first sends parameters and other
data to the application, then the application sends result data to the
Web server, and finally the application sends the Web server an
indication that the request is complete.<p>

All data that flows over the transport connection is carried in
<i>FastCGI records</i>.  FastCGI records accomplish two
things.  First, records multiplex the transport connection between
several independent FastCGI requests.  This multiplexing supports
applications that are able to process concurrent requests using
event-driven or multi-threaded programming techniques.  Second,
records provide several independent data streams in each direction
within a single request.  This way, for instance, both <tt>stdout</tt>
and <tt>stderr</tt> data can pass over a single transport connection
from the application to the Web server, rather than requiring separate
connections.</p><p>

</p><pre>        typedef struct {
            unsigned char version;
            unsigned char type;
            unsigned char requestIdB1;
            unsigned char requestIdB0;
            unsigned char contentLengthB1;
            unsigned char contentLengthB0;
            unsigned char paddingLength;
            unsigned char reserved;
            unsigned char contentData[contentLength];
            unsigned char paddingData[paddingLength];
        } FCGI_Record;
</pre>

A FastCGI record consists of a fixed-length prefix followed by a
variable number of content and padding bytes.  A record contains seven
components:<p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>version</tt>:

        Identifies the FastCGI protocol version.  This specification
        documents <tt>FCGI_VERSION_1</tt>.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>type</tt>:

        Identifies the FastCGI record type, i.e. the general function
        that the record performs.  Specific record types and their
        functions are detailed in later sections.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>requestId</tt>:

        Identifies the <i>FastCGI request</i> to which the record
        belongs.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>contentLength</tt>:

        The number of bytes in the <tt>contentData</tt> component of the
        record.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>paddingLength</tt>:

        The number of bytes in the <tt>paddingData</tt> component of the
        record.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>contentData</tt>:

        Between 0 and 65535 bytes of data, interpreted
        according to the record type.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>paddingData</tt>:

        Between 0 and 255 bytes of data, which are ignored.<p>
</p></li></ul>

We use a relaxed C <tt>struct</tt> initializer syntax to specify
constant FastCGI records.  We omit the <tt>version</tt> component,
ignore padding, and treat
<tt>requestId</tt> as a number.  Thus <tt>{FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1,
{FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE,0}}</tt> is a record with <tt>type ==
FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt>, <tt>requestId == 1</tt>, and <tt>contentData ==
{FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE,0}</tt>.<p>


</p><h5>Padding</h5>

The protocol allows senders to pad the records they send, and requires
receivers to interpret the <tt>paddingLength</tt> and skip the
<tt>paddingData</tt>.  Padding allows senders to keep data aligned
for more efficient processing.  Experience with the X window
system protocols shows the performance benefit of such alignment.<p>

We recommend that records be placed on boundaries that are multiples
of eight bytes.  The fixed-length portion of a <tt>FCGI_Record</tt>
is eight bytes.</p><p>


</p><h5>Managing Request IDs</h5>

The Web server re-uses FastCGI request IDs; the application keeps
track of the current state of each request ID on a given transport
connection.  A request ID <tt>R</tt> becomes active when the application
receives a record <tt>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST, R, ...}</tt> and
becomes inactive when the application sends a record
<tt>{FCGI_END_REQUEST, R, ...}</tt> to the Web server.<p>

While a request ID <tt>R</tt> is inactive, the application ignores
records with <tt>requestId == R</tt>, except for <tt>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</tt>
records as just described.</p><p>

The Web server attempts to keep FastCGI request IDs small.  That way
the application can keep track of request ID states using a short
array rather than a long array or a hash table.  An application
also has the option of accepting only one request at a time.
In this case the application simply checks incoming <tt>requestId</tt>
values against the current request ID.</p><p>


</p><h5>Types of Record Types</h5>

There are two useful ways of classifying FastCGI record types.<p>

The first distinction is between <i>management</i> records and
<i>application</i> records.  A management record contains information
that is not specific to any Web server request, such as information
about the protocol capabilities of the application.
An application record contains information
about a particular request, identified by the <tt>requestId</tt>
component.</p><p>

Management records have a <tt>requestId</tt> value of zero,
also called the <i>null request ID</i>.  Application
records have a nonzero <tt>requestId</tt>.</p><p>

The second distinction is between <i>discrete</i> and <i>stream</i>
records.  A discrete record contains a meaningful unit of data all by
itself.  A stream record is part of a <i>stream</i>, i.e. a series of
zero or more non-empty records (<tt>length != 0</tt>) of the stream
type, followed by an empty record (<tt>length == 0</tt>) of the stream
type.  The <tt>contentData</tt> components of a stream's records, when
concatenated, form a byte sequence; this byte sequence is the value of
the stream.  Therefore the value of a stream is independent of how
many records it contains or how its bytes are divided among the
non-empty records.</p><p>

These two classifications are independent.  Among the
record types defined in this version of the FastCGI protocol,
all management record types are also discrete record types,
and nearly all application record types are stream record types.
But three application record types are discrete, and nothing
prevents defining a management record type that's a stream
in some later version of the protocol.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S3.4">3.4 Name-Value Pairs</a></h4>

In many of their roles, FastCGI applications need to read and write
varying numbers of variable-length values.  So it is useful to adopt a
standard format for encoding a name-value pair.<p>

FastCGI  transmits a name-value pair as the length of the name,
followed by the length of the value, followed by the name,
followed by the value.  Lengths of 127 bytes and less can be encoded
in one byte, while longer lengths are always encoded in four bytes:</p><p>

</p><pre>        typedef struct {
            unsigned char nameLengthB0;  /* nameLengthB0  &gt;&gt; 7 == 0 */
            unsigned char valueLengthB0; /* valueLengthB0 &gt;&gt; 7 == 0 */
            unsigned char nameData[nameLength];
            unsigned char valueData[valueLength];
        } FCGI_NameValuePair11;

        typedef struct {
            unsigned char nameLengthB0;  /* nameLengthB0  &gt;&gt; 7 == 0 */
            unsigned char valueLengthB3; /* valueLengthB3 &gt;&gt; 7 == 1 */
            unsigned char valueLengthB2;
            unsigned char valueLengthB1;
            unsigned char valueLengthB0;
            unsigned char nameData[nameLength];
            unsigned char valueData[valueLength
                    ((B3 &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 24) + (B2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (B1 &lt;&lt; 8) + B0];
        } FCGI_NameValuePair14;

        typedef struct {
            unsigned char nameLengthB3;  /* nameLengthB3  &gt;&gt; 7 == 1 */
            unsigned char nameLengthB2;
            unsigned char nameLengthB1;
            unsigned char nameLengthB0;
            unsigned char valueLengthB0; /* valueLengthB0 &gt;&gt; 7 == 0 */
            unsigned char nameData[nameLength
                    ((B3 &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 24) + (B2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (B1 &lt;&lt; 8) + B0];
            unsigned char valueData[valueLength];
        } FCGI_NameValuePair41;

        typedef struct {
            unsigned char nameLengthB3;  /* nameLengthB3  &gt;&gt; 7 == 1 */
            unsigned char nameLengthB2;
            unsigned char nameLengthB1;
            unsigned char nameLengthB0;
            unsigned char valueLengthB3; /* valueLengthB3 &gt;&gt; 7 == 1 */
            unsigned char valueLengthB2;
            unsigned char valueLengthB1;
            unsigned char valueLengthB0;
            unsigned char nameData[nameLength
                    ((B3 &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 24) + (B2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (B1 &lt;&lt; 8) + B0];
            unsigned char valueData[valueLength
                    ((B3 &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 24) + (B2 &lt;&lt; 16) + (B1 &lt;&lt; 8) + B0];
        } FCGI_NameValuePair44;
</pre>

The high-order bit of the first byte of a length indicates the length's
encoding.  A high-order zero implies a one-byte encoding, a one a four-byte
encoding.<p>

This name-value pair format allows the sender to transmit binary values
without additional encoding, and enables the receiver to allocate the correct
amount of storage immediately even for large values.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S3.5">3.5 Closing Transport Connections</a></h4>

The Web server controls the lifetime of transport connections.
The Web server can close a connection when no requests are active.
Or the Web server can delegate close authority to the application
(see <tt>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</tt>).
In this case the application closes the connection at the end of
a specified request.<p>

This flexibility accommodates a variety of application styles.
Simple applications will process one request at a time and
accept a new transport connection for each request.  More
complex applications
will process concurrent requests, over one or multiple transport
connections, and will keep transport connections open for long
periods of time.</p><p>

A simple application gets a significant performance boost by
closing the transport connection when it has finished writing its
response.  The Web server needs to control the connection lifetime
for long-lived connections.</p><p>

When an application closes a connection or finds that a connection
has closed, the application initiates a new connection.</p><p>



</p><h3><a name="S4">4. Management Record Types</a></h3>


<h4><a name="S4.1">4.1 <tt>FCGI_GET_VALUES, FCGI_GET_VALUES_RESULT</tt></a></h4>

The Web server can query specific variables within the application.
The server will typically perform a query on application startup
in order to to automate certain aspects of system configuration.<p>

The application receives a query as a record <tt>{FCGI_GET_VALUES, 0,
...}</tt>.  The <tt>contentData</tt> portion of a <tt>FCGI_GET_VALUES</tt>
record contains a sequence of name-value pairs with empty values.</p><p>

The application responds by sending a record
<tt>{FCGI_GET_VALUES_RESULT, 0, ...}</tt> with the values supplied.  If the
application doesn't understand a variable name that was
included in the query, it omits that name from the
response.</p><p>

<tt>FCGI_GET_VALUES</tt> is designed to allow an open-ended
set of variables.  The initial set provides information to help
the server perform application and connection management:</p><p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>FCGI_MAX_CONNS</tt>:
        The maximum number of concurrent transport connections this
        application will accept, e.g.
        <tt>"1"</tt> or <tt>"10"</tt>.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>FCGI_MAX_REQS</tt>:
        The maximum number of concurrent requests this application
        will accept, e.g.
        <tt>"1"</tt> or <tt>"50"</tt>.<p>
      <em>NOTE: This value is per application, not per connection.</em>
    </p></li><li><tt>FCGI_MPXS_CONNS</tt>:
        <tt>"0"</tt> if this application does not multiplex
        connections (i.e. handle concurrent requests over each
        connection), <tt>"1"</tt> otherwise.<p>
</p></li></ul>

An application may receive a <tt>FCGI_GET_VALUES</tt> record at any
time.  The application's response should not involve the application
proper but only the FastCGI library.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S4.2">4.2 <tt>FCGI_UNKNOWN_TYPE</tt></a></h4>

The set of management record types is likely to grow in future versions
of this protocol.  To provide for this evolution, the protocol
includes the <tt>FCGI_UNKNOWN_TYPE</tt> management record.
When an application receives a management record whose type <tt>T</tt>
it does not understand, the application responds with
<tt>{FCGI_UNKNOWN_TYPE, 0, {T}}</tt>.<p>

The <tt>contentData</tt> component of a <tt>FCGI_UNKNOWN_TYPE</tt> record
has the form:
</p><pre>        typedef struct {
            unsigned char type;    
            unsigned char reserved[7];
        } FCGI_UnknownTypeBody;
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>type</tt> component is the type of the unrecognized management
record.</p><p>



</p><h3><a name="S5">5. Application Record Types</a></h3>


<h4><a name="S5.1">5.1 <tt>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</tt></a></h4>

The Web server sends a <tt>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</tt> record
to start a request.<p>

The <tt>contentData</tt> component of a <tt>FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST</tt> record
has the form:
</p><pre>        typedef struct {
            unsigned char roleB1;
            unsigned char roleB0;
            unsigned char flags;
            unsigned char reserved[5];
        } FCGI_BeginRequestBody;
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>role</tt> component sets the role the Web server expects
the application to play.  The currently-defined roles are:</p><p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>FCGI_RESPONDER</tt>
    </li><li><tt>FCGI_AUTHORIZER</tt>
    </li><li><tt>FCGI_FILTER</tt>
</li></ul>

Roles are described in more detail in
<a href="#S6">Section 6</a> below.<p>

The <tt>flags</tt> component contains a bit that
controls connection shutdown:</p><p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>flags &amp; FCGI_KEEP_CONN</tt>:
        If zero, the application closes the connection after responding to
        this request.  If not zero, the application does not close
        the connection after responding to this request; the Web server
        retains responsibility for the connection.<p>
</p></li></ul>


<h4><a name="S5.2">5.2 Name-Value Pair Stream: <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt></a></h4>

<tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt> is a stream record type used in sending
name-value pairs from the Web server to the application.
The name-value pairs are sent down the stream one after the other,
in no specified order.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S5.3">5.3 Byte Streams: <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt>, <tt>FCGI_DATA</tt>, <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt>, <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt></a></h4>

<tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt> is a stream record type used in sending arbitrary
data from the Web server to the application.  <tt>FCGI_DATA</tt>
is a second stream record type used to send additional
data to the application.<p>

<tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> and <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> are stream record types
for sending arbitrary data and error data respectively from the
application to the Web server.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S5.4">5.4 <tt>FCGI_ABORT_REQUEST</tt></a></h4>

The Web server sends a <tt>FCGI_ABORT_REQUEST</tt> record to
abort a request.  After receiving <tt>{FCGI_ABORT_REQUEST, R}</tt>,
the application responds as soon as possible with
<tt>{FCGI_END_REQUEST, R, {FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE, appStatus}}</tt>.
This is truly a response from the application, not a low-level
acknowledgement from the FastCGI library.<p>

A Web server aborts a FastCGI request when an HTTP client closes its
transport connection while the FastCGI request is running on behalf of
that client.  The situation may seem unlikely; most FastCGI
requests will have short response times, with the Web server providing
output buffering if the client is slow.  But the FastCGI application
may be delayed communicating with another system, or performing a
server push.</p><p>

When a Web server is not multiplexing requests over a transport
connection, the Web server can abort a request by closing the request's
transport connection.  But with multiplexed requests, closing the
transport connection has the unfortunate effect of aborting <i>all</i>
the requests on the connection.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S5.5">5.5 <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt></a></h4>

The application sends a <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt> record
to terminate a request, either because the application
has processed the request or because the application has rejected
the request.<p>

The <tt>contentData</tt> component of a <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt> record
has the form:
</p><pre>        typedef struct {
            unsigned char appStatusB3;
            unsigned char appStatusB2;
            unsigned char appStatusB1;
            unsigned char appStatusB0;
            unsigned char protocolStatus;
            unsigned char reserved[3];
        } FCGI_EndRequestBody;
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>appStatus</tt> component is an application-level status code.
Each role documents its usage of <tt>appStatus</tt>.</p><p>

The <tt>protocolStatus</tt> component is a protocol-level status code;
the possible <tt>protocolStatus</tt> values are:</p><p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li><tt>FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE</tt>:
        normal end of request.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>FCGI_CANT_MPX_CONN</tt>:
        rejecting a new request.  This happens when a Web server sends
        concurrent requests over one connection to an application that
        is designed to process one request at a time per
        connection.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>FCGI_OVERLOADED</tt>:
        rejecting a new request.  This happens when the application
        runs out of some resource, e.g. database connections.<p>

    </p></li><li><tt>FCGI_UNKNOWN_ROLE</tt>:
        rejecting a new request.  This happens when the Web server
        has specified a role that is unknown to the application.<p>
</p></li></ul>



<h3><a name="S6">6. Roles</a></h3>


<h4><a name="S6.1">6.1 Role Protocols</a></h4>

Role protocols only include records with application record
types.  They transfer essentially all data using streams.<p>

To make the protocols reliable and to simplify application
programming, role protocols are designed to use <i>nearly sequential
marshalling</i>.  In a protocol with strictly sequential marshalling,
the application receives its first input, then its second, etc. until
it has received them all.  Similarly, the application sends its first
output, then its second, etc. until it has sent them all.  Inputs are
not interleaved with each other, and outputs are not interleaved with
each other.</p><p>

The sequential marshalling rule is too restrictive for some
FastCGI roles, because CGI programs can write to both <tt>stdout</tt>
and <tt>stderr</tt> without timing restrictions.  So role
protocols that use both <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> and <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>
allow these two streams to be interleaved.</p><p>

All role protocols use the <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> stream just the way
<tt>stderr</tt> is used in conventional applications programming: to
report application-level errors in an intelligible way.  Use of the
<tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> stream is always optional.  If an application has
no errors to report, it sends either no <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> records or
one zero-length <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> record.</p><p>

When a role protocol calls for transmitting a stream other than
<tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>, at least one record of the stream type is always
transmitted, even if the stream is empty.</p><p>

Again in the interests of reliable protocols and simplified application
programming, role protocols are designed to be <i>nearly
request-response</i>.  In a truly request-response protocol, the
application receives all of its input records before sending its first
output record.  Request-response protocols don't allow pipelining.</p><p>

The request-response rule is too restrictive for some FastCGI roles;
after all, CGI programs aren't restricted to read all of
<tt>stdin</tt> before starting to write <tt>stdout</tt>.  So some role
protocols allow that specific possibility.  First the application
receives all of its inputs except for a final stream input.  As the
application begins to receive the final stream input, it can
begin writing its output.</p><p>

When a role protocol uses <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt> to transmit textual
values, such as the values that CGI programs obtain from environment
variables, the length of the value does not include the terminating
null byte, and the value itself does not include a null byte.  An
application that needs to provide <tt>environ(7)</tt> format
name-value pairs must insert an equal sign between the name and value
and append a null byte after the value.</p><p>

Role protocols do not support the non-parsed header feature
of CGI.  FastCGI applications set response status using
the <tt>Status</tt> and <tt>Location</tt> CGI headers.</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="S6.2">6.2 Responder</a></h4>

A Responder FastCGI application has the same purpose as a CGI/1.1 program:
It receives all the information associated with an HTTP request and
generates an HTTP response.<p>

It suffices to explain how each element of CGI/1.1 is emulated by a
Responder:</p><p>
</p><ul type="square">
    <li>
        The Responder application receives CGI/1.1 environment variables from
        the Web server over <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt>.<p>
    </p></li><li>
        Next the Responder application receives CGI/1.1
        <tt>stdin</tt> data from
        the Web server over <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt>.  The application receives
        at most <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> bytes from this stream before
        receiving the end-of-stream indication.  (The application
        receives less than <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> bytes only if the
        HTTP client fails to provide them, e.g. because the client
        crashed.)<p>
    </p></li><li>
        The Responder application sends CGI/1.1
        <tt>stdout</tt> data to the Web
        server over <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt>, and CGI/1.1 <tt>stderr</tt> data
        over <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>.  The application sends these
        concurrently, not one after the other.  The application must
        wait to finish reading <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt> before it begins
        writing <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> and <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>, but
        it needn't finish reading from <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt> before it
        begins writing these two streams.<p>
    </p></li><li>
        After sending all its <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> data,
        the Responder application sends a <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt> record.
        The application sets the <tt>protocolStatus</tt> component to
        <tt>FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE</tt> and the <tt>appStatus</tt> component
        to the status code that the CGI program would have returned
        via the <tt>exit</tt> system call.<p>
</p></li></ul>

A Responder performing an update, e.g. implementing a <tt>POST</tt>
method, should compare the number of bytes received on <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt>
with <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> and abort the update if the two numbers
are not equal.<p>


</p><h4><a name="S6.3">6.3 Authorizer</a></h4>

An Authorizer FastCGI application receives all the information
associated with an HTTP request and generates an
authorized/unauthorized decision.  In case of an authorized
decision the Authorizer can also associate name-value pairs
with the HTTP request; when giving an unauthorized
decision the Authorizer sends a complete response to the HTTP client.
<p>

Since CGI/1.1 defines a perfectly good way to represent the information
associated with an HTTP request, Authorizers use the same
representation:</p><p>

</p><ul type="square">
    <li>
        The Authorizer application receives
        HTTP request information from the Web
        server on the <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt> stream,
        in the same format as a Responder.  The Web server does not
        send <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt>,
        <tt>PATH_INFO</tt>, <tt>PATH_TRANSLATED</tt>, and
        <tt>SCRIPT_NAME</tt> headers.<p>
    </p></li><li>
	The Authorizer application sends
        <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> data in
	the same manner as a Responder.  The CGI/1.1 response
	status specifies the disposition of the request.  If the
        application sends status 200 (OK), the Web server allows
        access.  Depending upon its configuration the Web server
        may proceed with other access checks, including requests to other
        Authorizers.<p>

        An Authorizer application's 200 response may include headers
        whose names are prefixed with <tt>Variable-</tt>.  These
        headers communicate name-value pairs from the
        application to the Web server.  For instance, the response header
</p><pre>        Variable-AUTH_METHOD: database lookup
</pre>
        transmits the value <tt>"database lookup"</tt> with name
        <tt>AUTH-METHOD</tt>.  The server associates such name-value
        pairs with the HTTP request and includes them in subsequent
        CGI or FastCGI requests performed in processing the HTTP
        request.  When the application gives a 200 response, the
        server ignores response headers whose names aren't prefixed
        with <tt>Variable-</tt> prefix, and ignores any response
        content.<p>

	For Authorizer response status values other than "200" (OK), the
        Web server denies access and sends
	the response status, headers, and content
        back to the HTTP client.</p><p>
</p></li></ul>


<h4><a name="S6.4">6.4 Filter</a></h4>

A Filter FastCGI application receives all the information associated
with an HTTP request, plus an extra stream of data from a file stored
on the Web server, and generates a "filtered" version of the data
stream as an HTTP response.<p>

A Filter is similar in functionality to a Responder that takes a data
file as a parameter.  The difference is that with a Filter, both the
data file and the Filter itself can be access controlled using the Web
server's access control mechanisms, while a Responder that takes the
name of a data file as a parameter must perform its own access control
checks on the data file.</p><p>

The steps taken by a Filter are similar to those of a Responder.
The server presents the Filter with environment variables first,
then standard input (normally form <tt>POST</tt> data), finally
the data file input:</p><p>
</p><ul type="square">
    <li>
        Like a Responder, the Filter application receives name-value
        pairs from the Web server over <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt>.
        Filter applications receive two Filter-specific variables:
        <tt>FCGI_DATA_LAST_MOD</tt> and <tt>FCGI_DATA_LENGTH</tt>.<p>
    </p></li><li>
        Next the Filter application receives CGI/1.1 <tt>stdin</tt> data from
        the Web server over <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt>.  The application receives
        at most <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> bytes from this stream before
        receiving the end-of-stream indication.  (The application
        receives less than <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> bytes only if the
        HTTP client fails to provide them, e.g. because the client
        crashed.)<p>
    </p></li><li>
        Next the Filter application receives the file data from the
        Web server over <tt>FCGI_DATA</tt>.  This file's last
        modification time (expressed as an integer number of seconds
        since the epoch January 1, 1970 UTC) is
        <tt>FCGI_DATA_LAST_MOD</tt>; the application may consult
        this variable and respond from a cache without reading
        the file data.  The application
        reads at most <tt>FCGI_DATA_LENGTH</tt> bytes from this stream
        before receiving the end-of-stream indication.<p>
    </p></li><li>
        The Filter application sends CGI/1.1 <tt>stdout</tt> data to the Web
        server over <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt>, and CGI/1.1 <tt>stderr</tt> data
        over <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>.  The application sends these
        concurrently, not one after the other.  The application must
        wait to finish reading <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt> before it begins
        writing <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> and <tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt>, but
        it needn't finish reading from <tt>FCGI_DATA</tt> before it
        begins writing these two streams.<p>
    </p></li><li>
        After sending all its <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> data,
        the application sends a <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt> record.
        The application sets the <tt>protocolStatus</tt> component to
        <tt>FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE</tt> and the <tt>appStatus</tt> component
        to the status code that a similar CGI program would have returned
        via the <tt>exit</tt> system call.<p>
</p></li></ul>

A Filter should compare the number of bytes received on <tt>FCGI_STDIN</tt>
with <tt>CONTENT_LENGTH</tt> and on <tt>FCGI_DATA</tt>
with <tt>FCGI_DATA_LENGTH</tt>.  If the numbers don't match
and the Filter is a query, the Filter
response should provide an indication that data is missing.
If the numbers don't match and the Filter is an update, the Filter
should abort the update.<p>



</p><h3><a name="S7">7. Errors</a></h3>

A FastCGI application exits with zero status to indicate that it
terminated on purpose, e.g. in order to perform a crude form of
garbage collection.  A FastCGI application that exits with nonzero
status is assumed to have crashed.  How a Web server or other
application manager responds to
applications that exit with zero or nonzero status is outside the
scope of this specification.<p>

A Web server can request that a FastCGI application exit by sending it
<tt>SIGTERM</tt>.  If the application ignores <tt>SIGTERM</tt> the Web
server can resort to <tt>SIGKILL</tt>.</p><p>

FastCGI applications report application-level errors with the
<tt>FCGI_STDERR</tt> stream and the <tt>appStatus</tt> component of
the <tt>FCGI_END_REQUEST</tt> record.  In many cases an error will be
reported directly to the user via the <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> stream.</p><p>

On Unix, applications report lower-level errors, including
FastCGI protocol errors and syntax errors in FastCGI environment
variables, to <tt>syslog</tt>.  Depending upon the severity
of the error, the application may either continue or
exit with nonzero status.</p><p>

        <tt>" ... "</tt> is too long to display, so only a prefix is shown.

    </li><li>Messages sent to the Web server are indented
        with respect to messages received from the Web server.

    </li><li>Messages are shown in the time sequence experienced
        by the application.
</li></ul>

1. A simple request with no data on <tt>stdin</tt>, and a successful response:
<pre>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, "\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... "}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, ""}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, ""}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... "}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, ""}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</pre><p>

2. Similar to example 1, but this time with data on <tt>stdin</tt>.
The Web server chooses to send the
parameters using more <tt>FCGI_PARAMS</tt> records than before:
</p><pre>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, "\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SER"}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, "VER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... "}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, ""}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, "quantity=100&amp;item=3047936"}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, ""}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... "}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, ""}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</pre><p>

3. Similar to example 1, but this time the application detects an error.
The application logs a message to
<tt>stderr</tt>, returns a page to the client, and returns
non-zero exit status to the Web server.  The application
chooses to send the page using more <tt>FCGI_STDOUT</tt> records:
</p><pre>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, 0}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, "\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... "}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, ""}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, ""}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;ht"}
    {FCGI_STDERR,      1, "config error: missing SI_UID\n"}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "ml&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... "}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, ""}
    {FCGI_STDERR,      1, ""}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {938, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
</pre><p>

4. Two instances of example 1, multiplexed onto a single connection.
The first request is more difficult than the second, so the
application finishes the requests out of order:
</p><pre>{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   1, {FCGI_RESPONDER, FCGI_KEEP_CONN}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, "\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... "}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          1, ""}
{FCGI_BEGIN_REQUEST,   2, {FCGI_RESPONDER, FCGI_KEEP_CONN}}
{FCGI_PARAMS,          2, "\013\002SERVER_PORT80\013\016SERVER_ADDR199.170.183.42 ... "}
{FCGI_STDIN,           1, ""}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n"}

{FCGI_PARAMS,          2, ""}
{FCGI_STDIN,           2, ""}

    {FCGI_STDOUT,      2, "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... "}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      2, ""}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 2, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, "&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt; ... "}
    {FCGI_STDOUT,      1, ""}
    {FCGI_END_REQUEST, 1, {0, FCGI_REQUEST_COMPLETE}}
